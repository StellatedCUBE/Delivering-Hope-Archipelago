# Delivering Hope

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomisation do to this game?

Randomisation locks several aspects of the game until their respective items are found in the multiworld.
These include game modes, movement abilities, world characters and objects, Myth Galleria facilities, level-up upgrades, and optionally cosmetics.
Additionally, items that provide starting levels of various power-ups are optionally available.

## What is the goal of Delivering Hope when randomised?

The goal is configurable on the options page.
It consists of one or more of:

- Reaching some distance in each "normal" game mode (Standard, Classic, Baeless, Gacha)
- Reaching some clear time in The Cell mode
- Reaching some distance in Space mode
- Reaching some total score in Space mode
- Unlocking a list of achievements

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items from Delivering Hope are:
- Game modes
- World characters and objects
- Various abilities
- Fever zones
- Ina's laboratory
- The Phoenix Shop
- Level-up upgrades
- Space mode unlocks
- Upgrade starting levels
- Cosmetics
- Potion recipes
- Potions
- Hope Stones

Â 

Checks are:
- Achievements (configurable)
- Shop purchases
- Space mode unlocks
- Fusion discoveries (configurable)

## What does another world's item look like in Delivering Hope?

If they occur in the Phoenix Shop or in Space mode, other games' items will look like the Archipelago logo.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

It will be displayed as a popup in the lower left corner of the screen, the same as cosmetic unlocks.

## What counts as a death for the purpose of Death Link?

The following events will trigger a Death Link:
- Hitting Bae (without a blocking item or Rebirth)
- Stopping (without a Last Hope, and not in The Cell)
- Running out of fuel in Space mode

If the death is required to get a check (for example, Gravity) then a Death Link will not be sent.

## What happens when a Death Link is received?

If the player is in a "normal" game mode, IRyS will stop and fall, as if she hit Bae.

If the player is in Space mode, they will instantly lose all their fuel.

If the player is in a menu, nothing happens.
